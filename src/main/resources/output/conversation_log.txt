Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access

[2024-11-22 01:50:46] Ollama: Cloud computing provides on-demand access to scalable computing resources, such as data storage and computing power. Users don't manage these resources directly; instead, they request and receive them as needed. This model enables flexible, convenient, and ubiquitous network access, promoting cost-effectiveness and increased efficiency in various industries and applications.

Scalability: Cloud computing enables businesses and individuals to scale their resources up or down as needed, without the need for significant upfront investments in hardware or software. This flexibility is particularly useful for organizations that experience seasonal spikes in demand or unpredictable workloads.

[2024-11-22 01:50:55] Ollama: Cloud computing offers scalability by dynamically adjusting resource allocation based on changing demands. This allows businesses to quickly increase or decrease capacity as needed, reducing upfront costs and minimizing waste. It's ideal for companies with fluctuating workloads or seasonal peaks, enabling them to adapt efficiently and effectively.
